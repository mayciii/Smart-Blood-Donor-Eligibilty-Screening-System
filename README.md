# Smart Blood Donor Eligibility Screening System

## Project Overview

The Smart Blood Donor Eligibility Screening System is a desktop application developed using Python and Tkinter. This system automates the process of screening blood donors by evaluating their eligibility based on medical and health-related criteria.

It is designed to reduce manual errors, speed up the screening process, and assist medical personnel in determining whether a donor is qualified to donate blood.

## Objectives

- Digitize the blood donor screening process
- Automatically validate donor information
- Determine eligibility using programmed logic
- Provide a user-friendly graphical interface
- Assist in faster and more accurate decision-making

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Tkinter (GUI Framework)
- Conditional Statements
- Input Validation Logic

---

## System Features

- Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Donor information form
- Input validation (age, weight, health conditions, etc.)
- Risk factor assessment
- Automatic eligibility checking
- Instant result display (Eligible / Not Eligible)

---

## How the System Works

1. The user enters donor information in the form.
2. The system validates the input data.
3. Health conditions and risk factors are evaluated.
4. The program applies eligibility rules.
5. The system displays the final result:
   - Eligible to Donate
   - Not Eligible to Donate

---

## Sample Eligibility Criteria

The system checks the following:

- Age requirement
- Minimum weight requirement
- Existing medical conditions
- Recent illnesses
- High-risk behaviors
- Other health restrictions
